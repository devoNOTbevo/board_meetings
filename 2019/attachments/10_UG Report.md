  * Organizer subscription costs will drop to $2 per month, or $24 per year. That means organizers will be saving at least 80% annually on subscription fees. This will also distribute costs more evenly between organizers and members.
  * Members will pay a $2 fee when they reserve a spot at Meetup events.
  * UG Organizers are discussing Eventbrite as an option; but we appear to be fine with our Pro account
  * Additional discussion needed? Annoucement?
## Succession Planning
  * Carmen has trained Kristin twice on the basics, still more to cover
  * Timeline uncertain; will report back when Carmen returns
