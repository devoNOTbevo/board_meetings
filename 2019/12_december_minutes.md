## President's Report

StarSpace46 contract is currently operating under good will while Jeff wraps up signing it. Townhall did not happen this year in December but we may be going to a more frequent townhall style conversation with members in the next year. Considering a twice a year open forum. 

We have a good structure, still working on the structure. Room to grow but we are doing good. Thank you for your contributions.
