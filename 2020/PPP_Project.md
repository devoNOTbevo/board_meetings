# Community PPP Website Project
 
## Mission: Provide business owners a web-based SBA Payroll Protection Program form with calculations powered by Citizens Bank of Edmond, the Tom Love Innovation Hub and Techlahoma.
 
## MVP:
- Create a Domain Splash Page with general tools and steps for the site
- A Questionnaire will start the form to determine need and loan request amount.
- Replicate the existing PPP application into a web form
- Provide calculations/aggregations for the Loan Request using SBA tools and guidance from the CBE subject matter experts
- Allow the user to download the completed form as a PDF to take to a lender (link on site to SBA Lender Finder)
- No sign-in/user login to prevent data from being housed on the server (one time use)
 
## Needs:
- 1 Senior Engineer to architect and project lead
- 2-3 Junior/Student Engineers
- 1 Finance/Banking SME
- Brand/Domain Name
 
## Budget Request:
- $500-$1,000 Honorarium Senior Engineer (looking at developers who have lost their job due to COVID-19)
- $200-$450 Honorarium per Junior/Student Engineers
- Domain purchase: $20/yr
- Website Hosting: $40/month
- Future: Maintenance Engineer paid by hour to upkeep site
 
## Advising Tech Team:
- Kristin Garcia
- Jeff Lowe
- Chris Tse
- Aaron Krauss
- Diana Varnes
 
## Next step recommendations beyond MVP:
- Create a lender database for users to send their application to the lender to support this step of the business owners journey
- Create Tooltips within the application to assist with the form
