## Welcome
Kendall welcomed everyone to the call. We transitioned immediately into the Write-on report.

January minutes were approved with 7  affirmative votes and 1 abstain vote.

## Write-on Report
* Lindsay Jordan presents fundraising readiness assessment. 
* Techlahoma has hit or exceeded its ceiling to implement formal infrastructure or strategic vision. This has created barriers to effective fundraising and growth.
* Write-on gathered on-site feedback, 150+ survey responses.
* Techlahoma’s revenue strategy right now is risky because it’s dependent on two main conferences. These events are highly vulnerable to market conditions, natural disasters, and mitigating factors.
* We should move toward a more diverse portfolio of fundraising options. At the time of the report, we don’t have individual fundraiser data. 
	* We’re seeing a retention problem with individual donors. We saw a significant jump down in from 2017-2018.
	* Donors are telling us they’re not being adequately acknowledged or updated. Another sign of poor retention.
* Both interviews & surveys focused on 4 main themes: mission, programs, leadership, and revenue.
* We had an almost even split between people who believe the mission is to advance Oklahoma’s tech community vs. community & continuing tech education.
	* This split _might_ not be important. However, this could mean the mission statement isn’t accurately reflecting what the organization is actually doing.
	* New board members found the organization more effective than longer tenured members.
* Overwhelmingly the strengths of Techlahoma were annual conferences, Slack, and meetups.
	* The idea of meetups and the word community were almost used interchangeably. 24.5% of respondents mentioned conferences without being asked. 
	* 100% of survey respondents used the word “community” somewhere in their response.
* Areas for improvement include diversity & inclusion, talking about success stories.
	* Without prompting, many responses provided feedback on both sides of diversity & inclusion — both that the organization can do more and that the organization has made great strides.
	* Lindsay’s theory on diversity feedback: The tech industry has been dealing with this issue for a long time. The industry may have developed a complex around diversity. This may be viewed as a unique value proposition. Culturally, the organization needs to wrap its arms around this.
* For programs, the idea of “community” is prioritized by both members and volunteers.
	* Meetups are by far the most popular program, but their self-reported retention rate isn’t good. More than half of meetup attendants don’t attend consecutively. 25% believe the quality of service needs work.
	* Board and member feedback doesn’t align on workshops. Even though workshops rank low on awareness, workshops were ranked only behind meetups for _value_. 
	* Quality is an area for programs to improve across the board. 
	* About 20% of respondents said they’d attended a workshop.
	* Discussion by several members highlighted confusion around what is and isn’t a Techlahoma event or workshop.
	* “New skills development” ranked highest as both an expected and achieved outcome from Techlahoma programs.
	* “Help landing a new/better job” ranked lowest, which was surprising to Lindsay. 
* In the Culture section, respondents overwhelmingly indicated that they didn’t know or trust the organization’s top leaders. 
	* Strong emotional response typically indicates a strong sense of loyalty and knowledge of key issues. Indifference suggests that the organization isn’t communicating effectively with its members.
	* Information about the board, its roles, and how it functions could be more accessible to members. The goal should be to facilitate trust with members.
* About 86% of respondents would support a formal membership program.
	* About 30% of respondents responded “yes” to a more formal membership structure. ~30% answered “no”. ~40% were indifferent.
	* About a 10% change is normal for any change across an entire nonprofit.
* Business analysis.
	* Techlahoma’s primary strength is the membership. Members **love** Techlahoma.
	* But marketing and communication issues came up frequently.
		* Techlahoma has too many communication channels. Even though there’s many channels, the messaging is infrequent and confusing. 
		* Email and Slack were used most frequently. 
		* The lack of a cohesive communications strategy hearkens back to a the cultural lack of transparency and poses a significant barrier to fundraising. 
	* We need to tighten up protocols around marketing and communications before relying on them for fundraising.
	* Some respondents wanted text message updates. Several mentioned they weren’t able to find information on the website.
* Data indicates a toxic board culture bubbling under the surface. 
	* 80% of respondents think Techlahoma is doing a good job compared to only 50% of board members who feel the same. 
	* 40% of board members believe the organization’s reputation is “okay” or “poor” while no survey respondents out of 150+ gave the organization low marks.
	* Today’s board is at risk for burnout and is likely seeing early signs of martyrdom and disengagement.
	* There might be a need to reset expectations on key volunteers.
	* It’s also important to acknowledge how happy Techlahoma members have said they feel.
* Recommendations
	* **1) Bridge Plan.** Outline why the organization exists, how it impacts the world, what its programs are, and what action steps are needed over the next 12 months to realize the organization's short-term goals. This will include work on:
		* Mission statement
		* Program clarification 
		* Communication planning
		* Staff and board organizational charts
	* **2) Existential Threats.** Techlahoma has time before a new revenue program can be implemented and Executive Director hired. Take advantage of the timeline to address the organization's existential (cultural) threats: volunteer burnout, race and gender bias, and donor-centricity.
	* **3) Annual Fund Design.** Conclusion: Techlahoma is fundraising ready. We should develop a comprehensive revenue strategy with a formal membership program as a primary instrument.

## Coronavirus Updates
* We’ve sent updates and recommended that user group leaders move their meetings to a remote format.
* Q&A via Twitch for remote meetups has been slightly awkward. But mostly smooth operating overall for a change on short notice.
* Next steps: Take learnings from the first remote meetup and share with user group leaders as recommendations.
* Django Girls is postponed.
* We’re still determining the status of 200OK. 
	* Suggestions include canceling, moving to the Fall or switching to a remote format.

## Follow-up on Board Retreat Action Items
* Kendall recommends not holding a board meeting next month and instead meeting in smaller groups to work on board retreat action items and rework them to align with Write-on recommendations.
* Quick demo of the LinkedIn volunteer badge that Dodzi shared.
* Ryan: It would be nice if we had a web page or more visual explainer to help people update their LinkedIn profile.

## Adjourn
Since we spent the majority of the meeting on the Write-On Report and exceeded the normal end time, we moved to adjourn.
