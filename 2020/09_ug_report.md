## User Group General Updates
  - Not all UGs are meeting (I'll create an activity list to share this week)
  - Virtual Meetups are still taking place
  - Followup on Meetup:
   - Quick Slack Survey (9 replies)
   - All mentioned they needed something
   - Some requested access to websites but other commented that updating websites wouldn't be consistant
   - Overall: they need something to schedule events and invite, they rely on the event system, they want something with an API to push to other sources
## User Group Applications
   - Draft being worked on by Kristin & Emily
   - Deadline to push is October 15
   - Discuss deadline for return of applications (Nov 1 or 15)
   - Voting?
## Webinars
   - Still hosting two monthly webinars for New to Tech and Jobs in Tech
   - Discussed with Emily at some point figuring out a good onboarding system for new members
